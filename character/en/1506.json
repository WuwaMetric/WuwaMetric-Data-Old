Even on the darkest nights, when the storm has snuffed out all other light, she fills every room with a soft, radiant glow. A light so comforting it conveys the very essence of hope in the darkest of times. As written in the <i>Tenets of the Deep</i>, such light must have always existed in her heart, a sign of her relentless devotion...\n\n*This record has been transferred from the Orphanage to the <te href=850099>Order of the Deep</te>'s archives.\n \n<i>We have reason to believe that <te href=850100>Acolyte</te> Initiate Phoebe's unparalleled Resonance ability stems from her unwavering faith in the Divinity. \n\nThis is demonstrated by the rapport between her and the <ano=Divine Envoys><te href=850082>Echoes</te></ano>, a connection that has reinforced the trust some of our faithful have in her. Her active involvement in charitable works has already earned her recognition, therefore we have voted unanimously to grant her the title of Acolyte after her novitiate.\n \nHowever, some within the Order believe that her closeness with the Echoes violates the Order's doctrines. The blessings of the Divine Envoys are to be shared equitably, as the <te href=850083>Sentinel</te>'s love for Their people is impartial and untainted by favoritism. Being too close to the Divine Envoys could lead to unforeseen risks. For this reason, we do not recommend her appointment to the Servitude Hall, and believe it would be most prudent to transfer her to the Ministry of Holy Rituals instead...</i>",

      "Content": "On an ordinary afternoon, the wide streets of <te href=850097>Ragunna</te> bustled with people, more lively than in previous years.\n\nThe long-anticipated <te href=850102>Carnevale</te> was set to return, news that had already spread throughout Ragunna and even across the seas to distant shores. Over the past few days, travelers from all corners had appeared in the city. Even before dinner time, Trattoria Margherita was already packed with eager diners.\n\nRagunna's fine wines were as captivating as its breathtaking views. Nectarwine had the power to lull someone into a sweet dream, though overindulgence occasionally led to incidents.\n\nWhat started as a small disagreement over taste soon escalated into a heated debate. Perhaps it was the weariness of restraint, or perhaps the sleepy afternoon simply needed a bit of excitement. Either way, more and more people gathered, joining the argument.\n\nThe debate grew fiercer and, in the end, exploded into a full-blown fistfight.\n\nFor a moment, the restaurant became a stage. Pizzas and desserts flew through the air, seafood leaped from plates and landed on the faces of passersby, and onlookers scrambled to hide, though many couldn't help but peek back to watch the chaos unfold. \n\n\"Everyone! Oh, don't do that! You'll shatter the plates! Put down your cutlery, it's dangerous, you hear?\" The owner cried out, her tail puffed up as she jumped up and down, waving a pizza paddle. Still, she was too afraid to get too close to the commotion.\n\nJust then, a small figure darted from the crowd.\n\n\"Please, calm down!\"\n\nWith a staff in hand, the little figure traced a wide arc through the air. A golden bird descended from the sky, seemingly carrying the weight of the heavens. It barely touched the two enraged men on their foreheads, like a dragonfly skimming the surface of a pond.\n\nThe two men, who had been at each other's throats just moments ago, instantly calmed and fell face-first onto the table with smiles, snoring softly.\n \n\"Don't worry, they've just fallen asleep,\" said the petite blonde <te href=850100>Acolyte</te> as she tucked away her staff, \"However, disturbing public order is a violation of Order regulations. Those who disturb the peace must face appropriate punishment.\"\n\n\"Temperance is a virtue granted to us by the <te href=850083>Sentinel</te>. It makes both food and Nectarwine all the more delicious... I hope this little incident hasn't ruined anyone's enjoyment of their time here in Ragunna.\"\n\nThe Acolyte's smile was gentle and warm as the silence around her stretched on.\n \nBy the time more Acolytes arrived with La Guardia in tow, the commotion had already ended.\n\n\"Yes, yes, I saw it with my own eyes! She knocked out those two big guys with just one tap of her staff! Then, out of nowhere, a huge Plushie Echo appeared and carried them off! She looked young, but you can't judge a book by its cover...\"\n\nA diner, who had stayed behind to help clean up the aftermath, described the scene with no small amount of enthusiasm.\n\nThe lead Acolyte pulled out his Terminal to file a report, only to find that one had already been sent to the Order, detailing the incident and the whereabouts of the two who had been taken away.\n\n\"So... does that mean it's all taken care of?\"\n\n\"Of course.\" The Acolyte put away his Terminal with certainty.\n\n\"Leave it to Acolyte Phoebe. She knows how to handle these things better than anyone.\""

      "Content": "<i>Dear Mr. Claremont,\n\nI apologize for the delay in reaching out. I have been caught up with an overwhelming number of matters. It is with a heavy heart that I must bring you this tragic news: Our business partner, the Marinos, were attacked by <te href=850081>TDs</te> during their journey to the New Federation. Unfortunately, they did not survive. May the <te href=850083>Sentinel</te> guide their spirits to peace.\n\nRegarding payment for the sunken cargo, as per our previous agreement, I have begun liquidating the remaining assets of the Marino family. It is a most reluctant measure. You and I both know how much we invested in that deal. Now, with nothing left to sustain it, I am left only with the task of trying to fill the void in the best way I can.\n\nYou must remember Phoebe. The poor girl has lost her parents. She has nowhere to go, and as I am often away on business, I am unable to care for her as she deserves. I was told that you have a close relationship with a distant relative of the Marinos, and I pray you might consider offering her a home...</i>\n \nI folded the letter carefully, checked the address once more, and knocked again.\n\nThe repeated knocking had already drawn curious glances from the neighbors, but there was no response from within. The little girl stood quietly behind me, her head bowed, as if accustomed to such situations.\n\n\"They went on a holiday a while back,\" a passing neighbor mentioned casually. \"Might not be back for quite a while.\"\n\n\"I see, thank you. Come on, Phoebe.\"\n\nAs we turned to leave, I caught a glimpse of the curtain fluttering in the side window. I tightened my grip on Phoebe's hand, leading her away from the ostentatious neighborhood.\n\n<te href=850097>Ragunna</te> City was large, yet finding a home here was no easy task. I had lost count of how many doors I had knocked on, and how many times I had been turned away.\n\nAfter years of working in an orphanage, I had grown accustomed to all sorts of refusals, but I couldn't bear for Phoebe to experience this. She was still so young. What she needed was a warm, stable home, somewhere to heal in peace.\n\n\"We're deeply sorry... You have our sympathy for the girl's misfortune, but you understand adopting a child is more than just adding another plate to the table... Here, this is the least we can give. We wish you the best of luck.\"\n\n\"A letter? Ahem... I don't recall receiving any letter of this kind. Besides, didn't she already find a home at the orphanage? It's a fine place for children to live with others their age.\"\n\n\"...I've heard that the Marinos still haven't paid off their debts. We'd rather not have creditors knocking on our door. Please understand.\"\n\n...\n\n\"Don't be sad, Sister Isabella.\"\n\nAn ice cream was suddenly held out before me. A group of little <te href=850082>Echoes</te> had appeared around me unnoticed, each holding out ice creams and sweets meant for tourists. They were crowded around me, or rather, around Phoebe.\n\n\"I know the grown-ups are busy, just like Mother and Father were. They always came home so late.\"\n\nI stared blankly at the melting ice cream, caught off guard by the fact that this tiny child was offering comfort to <i>me</i>.\n\nThe Marino family, in their kindness, had helped the orphanage survive the worst of the Dark Tide. Yet here I stood, unable to find a proper home for their daughter. She should have been smiling in her parents' embrace, living a peaceful and happy life without worry.\n\n\"It's okay, I can... live with everyone else. I'm happy being with everyone.\"\n\nWhen I remained silent for a long while, the young girl looked up at me and gave me a quiet, almost soothing smile. My heart trembled.\n\n\"Everyone will stay together, right? Sister Isabella? The <te href=850100>Acolytes</te> tell us the Sentinel is always with us, keeping us together so we will never be apart.\"\n\nShe recited the words with such certainty. In the end, I could only swallow the lump in my throat, hold back my tears, and pull her close.\n\n\"All right... then let's go back. Let's go back home.\""

      "Content": "The storm in the dead of night seemed as if it would drain every last drop of water in <te href=850097>Ragunna</te>. Lightning flashed across the sky, casting webbed shadows upon a young girl curled up in her blanket.\n\nPhoebe couldn't fall asleep. Every time she closed her eyes, she saw the churning, furious sea. There, a lone ship would never return home, and she was sinking with it. \n\nOn nights like this, her father used to slip a locket with the <te href=850083>Sentinel</te>'s portrait under her pillow, telling her that the Divinity would guide her through the storms in her dreams to a safe harbor. Her mother would place a bouquet of daisies by her bedside and tell her bedtime stories. She would say that the Sentinel sends Divine Envoys to protect brave and kind children like her. \n\nBut now, the <te href=850100>Acolytes</te> would simply pat her head and tell her that she was like any other child. Every <te href=850096>Rinascitan</te> had to endure suffering before they could receive the Sentinel's forgiveness in the end.\n\nOnce, when she peered over an Acolyte's shoulder, Phoebe caught sight of the magnificent statue of the Sentinel for the first time. The sight of the immense, sinuous fishtail gave her a moment of panic, but the Acolyte's gentle hand on her shoulder and the soft, steadying prayer helped calm her trembling heart.\n\nShe was led into a warm, brightly lit room. The Acolytes treated her kindly, but she knew they probably preferred children who didn't bring trouble with them.\n\nPhoebe tried to remember the lullaby her mother used to sing, willing its melody to echo in her mind to drown out the howling storm outside.\n \nBut still, the relentless thunder and rain dragged her back to that dark night.\n \nShe had snuck aboard a merchant ship, peering through the porthole of the cargo hold to watch the distant horizon. When her parents returned, their sails would appear from that direction. She didn't want to wait for them anymore. This time, she was going to be brave and find them herself.\n\nBut the sea wasn't as gentle as her mother described in her stories. She began to hear hurried footsteps on the deck, the noise growing frantic until screams pierced the air as the ship was tossed violently in the storm's grip. The vessel began to sink.\n\nPhoebe cried out for her parents, but the raging waves seemed to whisper that they would never return.\n\nThe icy seawater engulfed her, and in her fading vision, she watched her father's locket disappear into the dark depths of the sea.\n\nWhen she opened her eyes again, she was lying on the shore, soaked to the bone. A <te href=850072>Tacet Mark</te> shone on her leg. The Acolytes who found her said no one could survive such a perilous sea, let alone a little girl. They believed it was a blessing from the Sentinel.\n\nBut Phoebe faintly remembered that something had saved her. A presence so gentle, like a soft breeze, had lifted her to the surface and laid her gently on the shore, telling her…\n\n<i>Don't be afraid. I'm here.</i>\n\nSomething pulled Phoebe from her dream. She felt the bed shift slightly, as though something soft and plush had nestled up beside her. It carried the dampness of the rain and the scent of daisies.\n\nThen Phoebe saw a pair of button eyes and soft, floppy ears—it was the stray <te href=850082>Echo</te> she had met in Whisperwind Haven earlier that day. She had untangled the kite string trapping it, naming it Brenno. Later, Brenno introduced Phoebe to many of its friends, took her cloud-watching on the hillsides, wiped away her tears, and even made her a wreath of pretty flowers.\n\n<i>Don't be sad, Phoebe.</i>\n\nThe Plushie's body felt warm and soft. In the haze of sleep, Phoebe felt a faint, familiar presence. It felt like the wind. \n\nShe buried her face into the Plushie's soft fur and slowly drifted back into a peaceful slumber."

      "Content": "As Phoebe woke up, she felt a lingering dampness at the corner of her eye.\n\n\"By the <te href=850083>Sentinel</te>'s grace, another day to rise and shine!\"\n\nShe leaped out of bed and quickly smoothed the bed sheets. The small bed that had been a part of her childhood still looked as familiar as ever. Phoebe gave her cheeks a few quick pats to shake off the morning drowsiness before diving straight into the day's tasks. \n\nThe orphanage was hosting a small celebration, and she had joined her senior <te href=850100>Acolyte</te> to help with the preparations. It would be her first time back since becoming an Acolyte Initiate. She had spent the previous evening talking with her brothers and sisters for a long while. Maybe that was why she had that dream about the past.\n\nEveryone commented on how capable and grown she looked now. She couldn't afford to disappoint their expectations.\n\nAfter morning prayers, Phoebe began preparing the necessary items for the celebration. The life of an Acolyte was busy yet fulfilling. For her, following a plan and seeing it come to fruition made her feel reassured and content. By the time the sun had climbed high in the sky, she and the other Acolytes had transformed the simple dining hall into a vibrant, colorful space. Phoebe set out the tea and snacks and watched the children, dressed in freshly laundered clothes pressed by the <te href=850082>Echoes</te>, rush excitedly into their caregivers' arms to receive their carefully wrapped presents.\n\nTouched by this warm scene, Phoebe couldn't help but smile.\n\nShe remembered how her father would always buy her a present during the first stop of his business trips. How her mother would always come up with a story about the present. Sometimes they were thrilling adventures, other times gentle bedtime tales. Her favorite gift had been a pink rabbit stuffed toy. In the story, she was an elegant musician.\n\nAs the darker parts of her past faded away, Phoebe found herself remembering only the bright, happy moments.\n\nA little Echo tugged on her sleeve, proudly showing her a big balloon it had just made. Instinctively, she reached out to pat its head.\n\n\"Acolyte Initiate Phoebe!\"\n\nHer senior's stern voice made Phoebe flinch. She quickly withdrew her hand and watched the Echo shuffle off with a hint of sadness. The senior's intense gaze seemed to pierce through her.\n\n\"By the Sentinel's grace, be mindful of your position.\"\n\n...She still hadn't fully adjusted to her new role. As an Acolyte, she couldn't have close attachments to the Echoes.\n\nThe Sentinel had led her to kind people, given her food to eat and provided a roof over her head. With these gifts came new responsibilities. As an Acolyte, it was her duty to repay such kindness.\n\nHowever, as Phoebe, she still had her own time to meet with friends.\n\nUnconsciously, her hand went to the locket hanging around her waist. It was her own little miracle. A treasure that her friends had helped bring back from the depths of the sea.\n\n\"Ms. Phoebe, my balloon got stuck in the tree and I can't get it down. Jimmy said you can fly. Could you...\"\n\n\"Of course!\"\n\nThe child tugging at her clothes snapped Phoebe out of her reverie. She set aside her tangled thoughts and returned to the crowd, immersing herself in the busy work of the celebration once more.\n \nAs the sun began to dip lower in the sky, the evening colors slowly spread across the horizon.\n\nThe day's work was done, the crowd had dispersed, and everything fell into peaceful quiet. Phoebe sat on a bench, closing her eyes and letting the soft sea breeze wash over her. Time seemed to slow.\n\nHer small figure appeared lonely against the setting sun. Her senior came looking for her, but noticing her shallow breathing realized that she had already fallen asleep. \n\nAs the girl slept soundly on the bench, quiet little Echoes crept up from the sides and huddled close to her side. \n\nThe older Acolyte sighed softly, turning away to leave her be.\n\n\"This time... I'll pretend I didn't see it.\""

But those childhood memories were too hazy to hold onto. Now, whenever she thought of the Carnevale, all that came to mind was a soft glow and distant echoes.\n\nYet she still remembered the expressions on her parents' faces. Their laughter had come from the heart. Memories that once caused her pain now glimmered deep within her.\n\nScenes that had once lived only in her dreams now unfolded before her eyes.\n\nShe stood among the crowd, watching the dark-haired hero bathe in light as a golden wreath slowly descended, settling atop {Male=his;Female=her} head.\n\nHer heart skipped a beat. Amidst the cheers, her gaze uncontrollably followed the golden light wherever it went.\n\n\"It's the <te href=850103>Laureate</te>!\"\n\n\"Praise <te href=850105>Imperator</te>!\"\n\n\"The <te href=850083>Sentinel</te> has sent us a miracle!\"\n\nHer vision blurred amid the tearful cries of joy.\n\nWho wouldn't be moved by such a dazzling sight? Even the Divinity had bestowed a miracle for such a moment. At that instant, Phoebe couldn't help but wonder: how could the Sentinel be angered by the people celebrating the Carnevale? Surely, the Sentinel loved the Carnevale and the joy of the people.\n\nThe faint shadow that had loomed her heart since returning from the Atrium of Reflections resurfaced, only to be momentarily washed away by the singing and laughter.\n\nBut this time, Phoebe clung to that fleeting trace of doubt. The things she had noticed, but had pushed aside. The questions that had risen, but which she had instinctively avoided confronting.\n\nPhoebe blinked hard, wiping away the tears at the corners of her eyes. She turned her gaze once again toward the figure surrounded by the crowd.\n\nShe had an inkling that {Male=he;Female=she} might hold the answers to clear her confusion.\n\nAnd one day, she would seek out the truth behind that doubt."
