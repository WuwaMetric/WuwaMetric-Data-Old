  "Desc": "An Overlord Class Howler TD hovering over Whining Aix's Mire. It soars the skies while singing elegies, and attacks fiercely any enemy that comes close.",
  "DescOpen": "This enemy has a <color=HighlightB>higher RES</color> to <color=Light>Spectro DMG</color>. \n\nA bird-of-prey-like animal that perches at the Whining Aix's Mire, with cries like a mournful song. \n\nLegend has it that this bird once had a partner and that their chorus was a beautiful sound. Their names were not passed down, but their hymns were recorded and preserved by human beings. \n\nUntil one of them was deceased. The surviving one cried all day long, and the cries were so dismal it was called the Mourning Aix. \n\nIn the loss of a lover, the bird became oppressive and violent, allowing no one to step into its nest of lost love. It only lingers in the heavens while singing the eulogy, in pursuit of an illusion that is no longer there among the clouds.",
