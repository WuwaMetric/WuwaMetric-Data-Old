  "Desc": "An Overlord Class Whisperin TD found outside Gorges of Spirit. Known to be bellicose, malevolent, and aggressive. Further observation is needed to better picture this creature.",
  "DescOpen": "This enemy has a <color=HighlightB>higher RES</color> to <color=Dark>Havoc DMG</color>. \n\nCrownless is a Whisperin Tacet Discord born outside the Gorges of Spirits along with the eruption of the strange Tacet Field. A vast mixture of human frequencies is detected within its physical form. For instance, the exhilaration and thirst for victory, the fear and resentment of loss... Humanity's long-suppressed barbarism is reified in Crownless and inflected against itself.\n\nThis creature is a pawn dispatched by the enemy in disguise, as well as a harbinger of the scourge of war.",
